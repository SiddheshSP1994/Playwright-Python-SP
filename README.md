# Playwright-Python-SP — Enterprise SDET Lab (Windows‑first)

> **Executive Value Summary (copy-ready for recruiters / CTOs)**
>
> **Outcome:** Cut regression time from **<Xh> → <Yh> (−<Z>%)**, stabilized **new-flake rate ≤ 1.0%**, and improved **MTTR by <A>%** using CI sharding, deterministic data, and AI-assisted triage.  
> **Risk Reduction:** Isolated third‑party volatility via FastAPI fakes (mail, payments), enabling **per‑PR validation** without external cost or rate limits.  
> **Speed to Decision:** Every run publishes a **one‑page executive summary** (pass %, retries %, new flake count, time‑to‑first‑failure, links).

## Why it matters (business outcomes)
- **Fewer escaped defects** on revenue flows (auth, checkout) → **revenue protection of <₹/$N> / quarter**.
- **Lead time to change** improved from **<D> days → <d> hours**, unblocking faster releases. 
- **Stability at scale:** **≤ 1%** new flakes; retries **≤ 2%**; **P95 latency** under **<ms>** in perf smoke.
- **Cost control:** CI wall time down **≥ 35%** via sharding + caching; PR feedback under **<N> min**.
- **Audit‑friendly:** Requirements‑to‑tests mapping enables compliance and traceability for stakeholders.

## KPIs (update weekly via CI)
| KPI | Target | Current | Delta vs. last week |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Regression wall time (E2E) | ≤ **<N> min** | <…> | <…> |
| New flake rate | ≤ **1.0%** | <…> | <…> |
| Retry rate | ≤ **2.0%** | <…> | <…> |
| Time‑to‑first‑failure | ≤ **<M> min** | <…> | <…> |
| Unit tests runtime | ≤ **60s** | <…> | <…> |
| Contract tests count | ≥ **10** | <…> | <…> |
| Executive summary attached | **100%** | <…> | <…> |

**Before → After (representative)**  
- **Checkout regression:** `<Xh>` → `<Yh>` (−`<Z>%`)  
- **Critical path outages:** `<N>` / quarter → `<n>` / quarter (−`<R>%`)  
- **Mean time to recovery (MTTR):** `<Mh>` → `<mh>` (−`<A>%`)

---

## Proof points (So‑What translations)
- **CI‑sharded Playwright+Pytest (~10k cases):** **Shortened regression cycles** to unblock daily releases while preserving coverage.
- **FastAPI fakes for Mail/Payment:** **De‑risked third‑party failures**; **cut test costs** to near zero for PR validation.
- **AI‑assisted triage plugin:** **Clustered failures** and highlighted top root‑cause signatures → **faster MTTR** and fewer noisy reruns.
- **Deterministic data builders:** **Stable, reproducible runs**; identical results across consecutive executions (±5% variance). 
- **Run summary for non‑technical stakeholders:** **Immediate go/no‑go visibility** with links to traces/videos.

---

## What this repo demonstrates (hiring lens)
- **Scalability:** Large E2E volume without losing speed (matrix + sharding, cached browsers/deps).
- **Reliability:** Flake budgets and deterministic data; retries bounded to control noise.
- **Extensibility:** Service fakes and a plugin system for triage → vendor‑neutral AI by default.
- **Governance:** Quality gates (lint/types/tests/flakes) enforce standards on every PR.
- **Operational reporting:** Executive one‑pager suitable for product/leadership consumption.

## Quick start (Windows 11)
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/SiddheshSP1994/Playwright-Python-SP.git
cd Playwright-Python-SP
py -3.11 -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -U pip && pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install
copy .env.example .env
python tools/run_all.py
```
Artifacts:
- **playwright-report/report.html**
- **artifacts/run-summary.md** (executive one‑pager)
- **artifacts/ai-triage.md** and **artifacts/triage.json**
- Traces/videos/screenshots under **artifacts/run_<timestamp>/**

---

## Architecture (at a glance)
- **Tests:** Pytest + Playwright; thin E2E backed by page/components; unit/contract layers encouraged.
- **Fakes:** FastAPI stubs for Mail and Payment behind `PAY_PORT` / `MAIL_PORT`.
- **Triage:** Pytest plugin emits clustered failures + AI summary (stub by default; OpenAI‑compatible optional).
- **Config:** `pydantic`‑based settings via `.env`; no hardcoded URLs/timeouts.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions matrix (10–16 shards), caching, artifact upload, and quality gates.

## LinkedIn (paste‑ready)
**Headline:** *Senior SDET | CI‑Sharded Playwright+Pytest (10k E2E) | AI Triage | ≤1% new flakes | Regression −<Z>%*

**Summary (3 sentences):**  
Built a Windows‑first Playwright+Pytest platform with CI sharding, deterministic data, and service fakes to protect critical commerce flows. Reduced regression time from **<Xh> → <Yh> (−<Z>%)**, held **new‑flake rate ≤ 1%**, and cut MTTR by **<A>%** via AI‑assisted failure clustering. Publishing an executive one‑pager on every run enables fast, low‑risk releases across multi‑OS/browser matrices.

**Experience bullet (ATS‑optimized):**  
*Designed and operated a CI‑sharded Playwright+Pytest framework (~10k parametrized cases) with FastAPI fakes, deterministic data builders, and AI‑assisted triage; reduced regression wall time by **<Z>%**, maintained **≤1%** new‑flake rate, and shipped executive run summaries that accelerated go/no‑go decisions.*

## Configuration (env)
```ini
# .env (example)
AI_ENABLED=1
AI_PROVIDER=stub         # stub | openai
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
AI_MAX_TOKENS=512
AI_TIMEOUT_SEC=20
PAY_PORT=8081
MAIL_PORT=8082
PYTEST_ADDOPTS=-q
```

---

## Quality gates
- `ruff` + `black` clean; `mypy` on `config/`, `plugins/`, `pages/`, `tools/`.
- New flakes ≤ **1.0%**; retries ≤ **2.0%**.
- CI wall time reduced by **≥ 35%** after caching/sharding.
- Perf smoke P95 ≤ **<ms>**; chaos nightly green.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Unknown marks:** register in `pytest.ini` (`smoke`, `regression`, `slow`).
- **Playwright missing:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` → `python -m playwright install`.
- **run_all args error:** run `python tools/run_all.py` without extra flags.

---

## Roadmap (public)
- Expand unit/contract layers; keep E2E thin + semantic.
- Weekly KPI auto‑update in README via CI.
- Nightly perf/chaos/security jobs with budgets enforced.
